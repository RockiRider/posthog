Helps you integrate with PostHog specifically designed with Vite in mind. Sits on top of [Posthog's Web SDK](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/js).

Currently compatible with **all** frameworks/libraries built by Vite, however we provide additional support for React (Hooks and Components) to make it easier to get started with React.

Additional support for other frameworks/libraries is planned, in order to make it easier to get started with PostHog in your framework/library of choice.

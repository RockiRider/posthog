# Vite Plugin Posthog

This is a plugin for vite that allows you to integrate with Posthog.

Its based on the official [Javascript SDK](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/js) and uses these under the hood.

## Advantages over the official JS SDK
- Easy to get started, just add the plugin to your Vite config.
- Easily turn off tracking in development mode

## Additional advantages over the official React SDK
- Faster initialisation, as it doesn't need to wait for React to load.
- Additional hooks and components to help you further integrate Posthog into your app.
- No need to wrap your app in an additional context component via `<PosthogProvider />`
